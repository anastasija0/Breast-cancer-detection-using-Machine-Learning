# Breast-cancer-detection

This project involves training a neural network model to detect breast cancer based on microscopic images of tumor tissue. We utilized a Kaggle dataset containing 7,909 imagesâ€”2,480 of benign tumors and 5,429 of malignant tumors.

The dataset was preprocessed, including image resizing and normalization, before being fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers to optimize feature extraction and classification.

The model was trained to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors, providing a valuable tool for early detection.
